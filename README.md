# Lassy

Lassy is an experimental C++ library for encapsulating and analysing data generated in cardiac eletrophysiology research. Lassy currently incorporates models only for the left venricle and atrium. 

It is being currently developed for computing the complexity of scar in [Re-entrant ventricular tachycardia research](https://wwwhomes.doc.ic.ac.uk/~rkarim/mediawiki/index.php?title=Scar_complexity)


## Usage
There are several tools within the library. 

The tool can be used to interrogate late gadolinium enhancement CMR images of the ventricular myocardium. 

It takes input parameters such as:  

```-i``` Ventricular myocardial shell in VTK format
